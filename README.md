# ft_containers

--------- Mandatory part ---------
Implement the following containers and turn in the necessary <container>.hpp files:

• vector

You don’t have to do the vector<bool> specialization.

• map

• stack
It will use your vector class as default underlying container. But it must still be
compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.
You can pass this assignment without the stack (80/100).
But if you want to do the bonus part, you have to implement the 3
mandatory containers: vector, map and stack.

You also have to implement:
• iterators_traits

• reverse_iterator

• enable_if
Yes, it is C++11 but you will be able to implement it in a C++98 manner.
This is asked so you can discover SFINAE.

• is_integral

• equal and/or lexicographical_compare

• std::pair

• std::make_pair
